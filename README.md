Robotics is the next disruptor which is obvious, electronics, data science and hardware knowledge is very important to make a mark in this field. Robots ranging from small printing machines to huge arm movements are very precise which has been possible by introducing a new generation of motors known as STEP Motor or STEPPING Motor and popularly known as STEPPER Motor.
